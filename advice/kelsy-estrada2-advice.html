                <h4>You're  &#10024;learning&#10024; and that is okay!</h4>
                <p>Learning means that you're going to not know everything, that you're
                    going to mess up some things, that you're going to move slow. It is all
                    a part of the learning process! You'll get better over time. &#128515; 
                </p>

                <h4>Try to learn a little bit everyday, even if it is only 5 mintues.</h4>
                <p>Practice makes perfect! When learning a new skill, try to do small chucks more often
                    rather than big chunks sometimes. It is a better way to learn any skill. You need to practice often, but have time to digest the material you're practicing.
